OpenCorsairLink
===============
## Warning: This was a weekend project after buying the H100i for a Linux Server. Some or most things might not work for you!
## Previous version of OpenCorsairLink has been moved to the legacy branch!

Supported Water Coolers (but not fully tested):
 - USB HID:  
 - H80i (HID)

### What should work:
LED control  

### What doesn't work:
Pretty much everything, either doesn't work or untested!  
The program currently doesn't know the difference between Water Coolers... yet!  

### Dependencies
libusb-1.0  

### Running
Since the program needs direct hardware access you should run this with 'sudo' or as root.
